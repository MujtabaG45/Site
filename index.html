    <h2>Things about me!</h2>
    <p>I enjoy watching YouTube and Anime and some gaming, though my hardware is very underpowered so my free time is mainly YouTube. I'm currently a student so I don't have that much free time (I'm sure fellow students can agree), and I'm big on Privacy (like DeGoogling).</p>
